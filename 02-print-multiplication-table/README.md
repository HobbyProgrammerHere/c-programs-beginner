# Multiplication Table Program

This program prints the multiplication table for a number entered by the user — from 1 to 10 — in two mirrored formats.

- ✅ Demonstrates use of `printf` formatting (`%.3f`, `%2d`, `%6.3f`)
- ⚠️ Currently uses `%f` format specifiers for input and output — this may show decimals even if the input is an integer

📄 Code is in `main.c`  
📝 Inline comments explain formatting choices
